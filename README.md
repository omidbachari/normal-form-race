# Normal Form Race - Video Game Consoles as Data

The domain of this sample site is video game consoles. Users are invited to provide information about 3 different video game consoles they are using at home. That information is then presented back to the user in different relational data models. The purpose of the app is to illustrate different levels of normalization.

A further goal of the app is to provide analysis of the physical implementation of each form. How well does a database perform with each implementation?

This app is meant to illustrate different levels of normalization for the educational benefit of the user. Please send feedback and suggestions to [omidbachari@gmail.com](omidbachari@gmail.com).  


# User Stories

## Core Functionality

### User sees homepage  

As a user  
I want to navigate to a home page and see a form and instructions  
So that I know what the purpose of the site is

#### Acceptance Criteria  

* [] I see static instructions
* [] I see a form

### User submits raw data

As a user  
I want to submit raw data, using the form  
So that I can see the different relational data modeling schemes

#### Acceptance Criteria

* [] I fill the fields with information
* [] The fields constrain data to a limited domain
* [] I am presented with errors if something is blank or incorrect
* [] I am able to submit the data
* [] If error-free, am redirected to the page containing my data

### User sees data in different models

As a user
I want to see my submitted data presented in different models
So that I can compare the different levels of normal forms

#### Acceptance Criteria

* [] I see four different presentations, corresponding to Universal Relations, First Normal Form, Second Normal Form and Third Normal Form
